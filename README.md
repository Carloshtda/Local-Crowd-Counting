# Adaptive Mixture Regression Network with Local Counting Map for Crowd Counting
By Xiyang Liu, Jie Yang, Tieqiang Wang, Wenrui Ding

More code and models will be released soon. Stay tuned.

### Introduction
In this work, we introduce a new learning target named local counting map, and
show its feasibility and advantages in local counting regression. Meanwhile, we
propose an adaptive mixture regression framework in a coarse-to-fine manner.
It reports marked improvements in counting accuracy and the stability of the
training phase, and achieves the start-of-the-art performances on several author-
itative datasets. For more details, please refer to our [arXiv paper]().
